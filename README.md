Here’s a suggested description for the **Event Sequence Model** repository on GitHub:

---

### **Event Sequence Model**

The **Event Sequence Model** repository is a core component of the **Log Events Monitoring and Prediction System**, dedicated to identifying patterns in structured log data and predicting future events. This repository hosts the logic, configuration, and integration for advanced machine learning models designed for sequence analysis and prediction.

---

### **Features**
- **Sequence Analysis**:
  - Processes structured log data to extract meaningful sequences of events.
  - Identifies temporal and contextual patterns in event sequences.

- **Advanced ML Models**:
  - Supports various sequence models, such as RNNs, Transformers, and attention-based models.
  - Easily integrates with pre-trained models or custom architectures.

- **Integration with Other Components**:
  - Receives structured logs from the Event Processing and Tagging (EPT) component.
  - Sends predictions to downstream components like the Ranking Model and EventSpecialist.

- **Configuration and Extensibility**:
  - Fully configurable via YAML files for hyperparameters, model paths, and input/output settings.
  - Allows for seamless addition of new models or configurations.

- **Real-Time and Batch Processing**:
  - Enables real-time inference for live systems.
  - Supports batch processing for offline analysis.
